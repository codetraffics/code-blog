# Communication Breakdowns

Software developers need clear instructions and guidance from project managers in order to handle their jobs effectively. Therefore, if they are left in the dark, it can result in chaos and confusion, which affects the overall software product quality in one way or another. This is the most common yet biggest challenge that possibly leads to project failure or delays.

Without proper strategy or direction, you and other team members could be miles away from the right track. Thus, let’s trace to the root, which is as obvious as daylight - to establish a clear and concise project plan. The project manager communicates and collaborates with all stakeholders (Including business analysts, quality assurance engineers, technical architects, developers, etc.)

Together, they work to define the software’s objectives, scope, timeline, and milestones. In this way, all involved stay on the same page. Beyond planning, management positions must actively engage with each team member to foster a work environment that is conducive to productivity.
