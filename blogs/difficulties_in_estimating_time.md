# Difficulty in Estimating Time & Resources

It is not rare to see software development projects facing the issues of estimating resources, which later leads to insufficient allocation.

Given the time and budget constraints, it is important to have realistic timelines for a software project that outlines every single detail, stage, and task of the project. By visualizing the whole roadmap, project managers or leaders have better insights to calculate and balance the workload and manpower in accordance with the defined timeline.

This way, developers know how much time they can spend on enhancing a certain feature or working on software testing and bug fixes, for instance. If a developer has too little time to work on the part of the project, it may not function properly or have features that are lacking. If we underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete a task, there will be delays in the project, and other members of the team may run out of work. On the other hand, if it takes longer than expected, then the project will stretch into an uncomfortable timeframe.

In terms of solutions, project managers should also consider one way - to break larger tasks into smaller chunks so they are more manageable. Also, developers can make use of project management tools (Such as Toggl or Harvest) to keep track of how much effort their teams are investing in a single task.

Additionally, setting deadlines is needed to help developers manage project activities and prioritize their tasks efficiently, knowing which ones need to be accomplished before others by a specific date. They are able to factor in any potential software development problems that may arise and work on a backup plan.
