# Hunting for Qualified Software Developers

In the current IT market, software developers, particularly skilled ones, are challenging to find, hire, and retain. There are many reasons behind this, such as the shortage of qualified workers and the overhead costs of recruiting, not to mention the troubles of getting the wrong hires or the resources and effort to maintain a full-fledged team. In addition, a majority of tech companies nowadays are reluctant to employ fresh graduates due to the concern of lacking experience and necessary skills.

To overcome this challenge, companies need to be more proactive in their search for talent. They should identify the skills they need and target candidates who have those skills. They should also create an attractive job offer that includes benefits and a competitive salary. In addition, they should actively promote their company and its culture. By doing these things, companies can attract more talent and continue to grow their businesses.

Moreover, companies can also consider using recruitment agencies or online platforms that provide ready-made resumes for professionals with different qualifications and skill sets. Or they should be more flexible in talent acquisition by giving more opportunities to interns. Currently, more and more many software companies are outsourcing software development work to third-party companies, which can be a more cost-effective way to find the right talent.
